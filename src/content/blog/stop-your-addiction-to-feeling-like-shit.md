# Break Your Addiction to Feeling Like Shit and start taking action!

Lick the floor.

No, I'm dead serious. Drop down, stick out your tongue, and give the floor a good ol' lick. Disgusted yet? Good. That's the exact reaction you should have to your current habit of letting life walk all over you. You're out here metaphorically licking the floor of life every single day—letting negativity, self-doubt, and stress turn you into a doormat. And it's time to stop.

You wouldn't voluntarily lick a dirty floor, right? So why on earth are you voluntarily wallowing in self-pity and negativity? You've gotten comfortable feeling like crap. Comfortable with letting the worst parts of your day define the entire thing. But here's the good news: you can break this gross habit starting right now.

Let's face it: you've been stuck in a pattern of feeding your inner critic, giving the same old excuses why you are not executing things and taking action, constantly replaying the same tired script about why you're not good enough, why things aren't going your way, or why life feels like a struggle. It's a cycle. And you're licking the floor of life every time you give in to it.

## How Did You Get Addicted to Feeling Like Crap?

You didn't choose this, but you sure as hell enabled it. You've been allowing small, daily doses of negativity to pile up cheetos dust on your keyboard. It's the sum of all those little mental habits you've let slide for years. Here's what you've been feeding on:

- **Negative self-talk:** That voice in your head is constantly spitting out lies, and you're swallowing every single one.
- **Endless comparisons:** You keep measuring your life against others'. Your Saas idea is still an idea while this and that is making $10k MRR.
- **Perfectionism:** You're chasing an impossible standard, and every time you miss it, you punish yourself, byt NOT Shipiing it. 
- **External validation:** You're hooked on getting praise and approval from others, but the hit never lasts.
- **Comfort in misery:** It's easier to stay in the mud you know than to get up and clean yourself off. Plus misery loves company so what could be better than whine on Socials.

Sound familiar? Of course, it does. But here's the thing: you can stop. You *must* stop. It's time to spit out the lies, stop licking the floor, and start taking control of your life. Take Action and start shipping!

## Breaking the Addiction to Misery

Enough of this nonsense. You can't wait around hoping to magically feel better. You have to take action. Here's how you can kick the habit of feeling like crap—and no, it's not some "manifest your dream life" fluff. It's about doing the work, even when it feels uncomfortable. Yes there is a time and place for manifestation and all that but this is NOT that time.

### 1. Snap Yourself Out of It

When that wave of negativity starts to roll in, stop it dead in its tracks. Don't just sit there letting it sweep over you. Stand up. Do something ridiculous like jumping jacks or sing the chorus of the dumbest song you know at the top of your lungs. The goal is to break the pattern. Don't marinate in the misery. Disrupt it. Kill it.

### 2. Quit the Comparison Game

You know that person you're constantly comparing yourself to and the product he/she has built? They're dealing with their own brand of chaos, you just don't see it. You're comparing your lowest points to their highlight reel, and you're losing a game that was rigged from the start. Let it go. Focus on your own path and stop measuring your life against someone else's exit level MRRs.

### 3. Perfectionism is a Scam like Mike White is not from Microsoft helpdesk

Perfect doesn't exist. The sooner you accept that, the better. Aim for progress, not perfection. Get things done, even if they're messy or flawed. Each small step you take forward is worth way more than standing still, obsessing over an impossible ideal. If you fail, at least you failed fast and you can regroup, recalibrate, rebuild and relaunch!

### 4. Treat Yourself Like You Matter

You've been your own worst enemy for far too long. The way you talk to yourself? It's brutal. You'd never speak to a friend that way, so why are you doing it to yourself? Start treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you'd show a loved one. Build yourself up instead of tearing yourself down.

### 5. Get Into Motion

When you're stuck in your head, the best way out is through action. Get moving—literally. Go for a walk, do a workout, or just dance around like nobody's watching. Shifting your physical state is a fast way to change your mental state. You don't have to feel good to do it; you just have to do it. Plus you might loose few kilograms of weight while you are at it. Healthy body healthy mind.

### 6. Practice Gratitude

This one may sound basic, but it works. Gratitude isn't about ignoring the bad stuff; it's about noticing the good things even when life feels hard. Start small. Write down three things you're grateful for every day, no matter how minor. Maybe it's a great cup of coffee or zero bugs in your code. Whatever it is, focusing on the positive will shift your mindset from scarcity to abundance. Smile..yes I said it smile and you start to feel better immeadiately thanks to human physiology and hormonal chemistry.

## Why You Need to Stop Licking the Floor of Life

I'm not saying everything will magically get better the moment you stop wallowing in negativity. But here's the thing: nothing will change if you keep letting yourself spiral into a pity party every time life doesn't go as planned. You need to get uncomfortable, shake things up, and disrupt your toxic thought patterns. 

Think of it this way: if you wouldn't willingly lick a dirty floor, why the hell are you willingly soaking up all the mental dirt that's holding you back?

## Tough Love Time: It's Up to You

Here's the cold, hard truth: no one's coming to rescue you from your bad mood. You can read all the self-help books and motivational quotes in the world, but until *you* decide to change the way you're treating yourself, nothing's going to get better. Unfortunately its that simple. No gurus needed. JUST TAKE ACTION!

You are the one in charge here. You get to decide whether to keep feeding into negativity or to start building a better, healthier mindset. It won't be easy, and there will be days where you fall back into old habits. But every time you choose to break the cycle, you're reclaiming control over your life.

## The Outcome: What Happens When You Stop?

When you stop feeding the addiction to negativity, everything starts to shift. You'll notice the small wins, the moments of joy you used to overlook. You'll find yourself lighter, more resilient, and better equipped to handle the curveballs life throws your way. 

So, what's it going to be? Are you ready to stop licking the metaphorical floor and start living the life you actually deserve? The choice is yours.

And remember: no more floor-licking.
